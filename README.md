# Smile Classifier
This project implements a step-wise ensemble classifier to detect smiles in 24Ã—24 grayscale images. The classifier makes predictions using binary pixel comparisons and selects the most informative features using a greedy step-wise approach.

## Features
* **Step-wise Feature Selection**: Iteratively selects the best pixel comparison features to maximize accuracy.
* **Ensemble Classification**: Uses an ensemble of 6 weak classifiers to improve performance.
* **Vectorized Implementation**: Optimized for efficient computation without loops.
* Training & Testing Analysis: Evaluates accuracy as a function of training set size.

## Dependencies
Make sure you have the following Python libraries installed:  
```bash
pip install numpy matplotlib
```

## Run Instructions
Run the main script to train and evaluate the model:  
```bash
python smile.py
```
